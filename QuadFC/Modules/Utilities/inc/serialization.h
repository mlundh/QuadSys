 * Serialize the value pointed to by value.
 * @param buffer    Pointer to the buffer where the serialized value will be stored.
 * @param size      Pointer to the size of the buffer. This will be updated to reflect
 *                  the remaining size after writing the data.
 * @param value     Pointer to the value to serialize. Used a pointer so that the interface
 *                  is similar for simple and complex types.
 * @return          Pointer to the end of the written data. Use this together with the size
 *                  parameter to continue the serialization.
