 * @brief state vector describing the copters attitude in

 *
 * In order to get the orientation of the copter in terms of angles,

 * The euler angles are denoted pitch, roll and yaw. This is common
 * practice in avionics.
 *
 * The state vector is described in SI units with a scale factor.
 *
 * Scale factors used:
 * angle: 16.16 signed fixed point with 1 as pi rad.
 * pi rad/(2^(16)) = 0.0000479368997 rad/LSB, gives that 1 LSB shifted
 * up by 16 will correspond to pi rad. This is a BRAND.
 *
 * Angular velocity: 16.16 signed fixed point with 1 as pi rad / second.
 * pi rad/(2^(16)) = 0.0000479368997 rad/s/LSB, gives that 1 LSB shifted
 * up by 14 will correspond to pi rad per second.

 *
 * Thrust:
 * Thrust is not a real state, but is added here for simplicity.
 * Scaling: 16.16 fixed point, 100% = 1<<30
